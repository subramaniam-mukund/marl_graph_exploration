# Spatial-Memory for Curiosity-based Exploration in Graph Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

## Environment Details:

Core Routing Environment and Baseline Implementations adapted from https://github.com/jw3il/graph-marl

## Experiments Scripts:

Scripts can be found in /scripts/:

  For running our Shortest-Path Outlier Experiment: /scripts/shortest_path.sh
  
  *For running our Baselines, ST-DGN, and ST-DGN + SMCE implementations: /scripts/start_routing_runs.sh
  
  *You can modify the traffic settings by modifying the number of agents (n_data)
